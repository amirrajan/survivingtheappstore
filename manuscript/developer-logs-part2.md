**Mar 31, 2014: Attack of the Minecraft Clones, and a New Hope in the United Kingdom** <a href="#minecraft"><small>permalink</small></a>

For the past two weeks, a certain "anomaly" has existed in A Dark Room's small part of the App Store. There are two games that have managed to take top spots in the RPG category: Skyblock - Survival Game Mission Flying Island (which I'll call Skyblock1) and Skyblock - Mini Survival Game in Block Sky Worlds (which I'll call Skyblock2). Skyblock1 and Skyblock2 hold the _first_ and _tenth_ spot in the RPG category. The average rating for both games are two stars.

I'm not sure what is going on here. I am well accustomed to the "I don't get it this is dumb" one-star review (I see that as a failure on my part by the way...). And here are two apps, that are in the top 10, and their reviews are mostly poor. Are the people that are reviewing this game, simply "not getting it"? Where are the reviews of people that enjoy the game?

[As I've mentioned before](#top6), getting a top spot in rankings takes a consecutively high number of downloads, day after day. These games have been holding a top spot now for what looks like _two weeks_. These games are definitely bringing in a high number of downloads, but very few good reviews.

Is the Minecraft "franchise" simply that popular? Here is a list of Minecraft based games that are high ranking right now:

- Skyblock - Survival Game Mission Flying Island (#1 spot, 2-star average)
- Hunt Games - Mine Mini Survival Game with Blocks (#9 spot, 2-star average)
- Skyblock - Mini Survival Game in Block Sky World (#10 spot, 2-star average)
- Minecraft Skin Studio - Official Skins Creator for Minecraft (#12 spot, 4.5-star average)
- Adventure With Companions - 3D Online Multiplayer Block Building Sandbox With Creative (#17 spot, 4-star average)
- Minecraft Explorer Pro (#18 spot, 3.5-star average)
- World Explorer - Made for MineCraft (#19 spot, 2.5-star average)

A Dark Room is currently ranked 20, with 220 reviews, average 5-star rating... in the United States.

A few days ago, I saw a small spike in downloads. I didn't think too much of it. Yesterday, there was a 300% increase in A Dark Room's downloads. This got my attention. I tried to make sense of why this spike existed. App Annie, a site I use to track this stuff, showed a disproportionate number of downloads in the United Kingdom App Store. After looking at rankings, I saw that A Dark Room was recently promoted to the #1 spot in the UK App Store. Not #1 RPG, not #1 Game, **A Dark Room is currently the #1 app _overall_.**

I don't have any details (yet) about what impacted this, or how many downloads this will translate to in the long run. One thing I've learned so far, you have to have tempered expectations. I've reached out to [Cara Ellison](#cara) and [Leigh Alexander](#leigh) (editors in the UK) to see if they have any idea about what's going on. I'm still trying to connect the dots... trying to understand how this happened. I'll add another entry as soon as I do.

**Apr 1, 2014: Day Two, at the Number One Spot, in the UK App Store** <a href="#topappday2"><small>permalink</small></a>

A Dark Room has managed to stay number 1 in the UK App Store for March 30th and 31st (so far). Here are my observations:

Downloads have dropped 10% from D-day (March 30th). This was surprising given that when the [app was free](#freeagain), the downloads were higher on day two.

The gains in the UK App Store don't seem to be influencing US sales. It may be too early to say this, but that's what I've seen so far.

<a id="empathy"> </a>

Another observation (and I think this is unique to the game), is there is now a higher number of 1-star reviews. For the past two days, A Dark Room has received 59 5-star reviews and 38 1-star reviews.

If you've played the game, you know that the first part of the game has a slow reveal, and opens up "phase 2" only after you've bought the compass. I'm trying to put myself in the shoes of those that are in the UK. Here is a game... and it's the top app in the App Store. There is only one screen shot, a vague description and many of the review say the same thing:

>**A-MAZING** - I don't write reviews. I find those "Rate this Game" popups extremely annoying. This game doesn't have those. Instead it waits until right at the end, after it has blown your mind, to ask for a rating. And for the first time ever, I felt obliged.

>**One of a kind! Superb** - "I never write reviews," or "I hardly write reviews!" That's how all of the others have begun and if that doesn't draw you in then you shouldn't be on the App Store. This unique game has kept me entertained for hours on end...

>**Wow!** - Well where to begin, I read the reviews and not knowing anything about the game I took a punt on it and I'm glad I did! What a brilliant game! ...

>**;)** - A brilliant game very addictive and interesting concept. I would highly recommend it

>**Fantastic** - Really atmospheric, very minimalist: an rpg, a survivor sim, a text adventure. Absolutely brilliant and shows you don't need grafix to make a really absorbing atmospheric game.

I decide to give the game a shot. I _pay_ money for it. Pressing the buy button is a very powerful gesture. It doesn't matter if the app I am buying is $1 or $100. The act of buying something in the App Store has become an exchange of trust, more so than an exchange of money. When I hit the buy button, I am putting trust in the developer, trust in the App Store to curate apps, trust in the reviews that they are accurate and true.

So here I am, a random person browsing the App Store, I may not even be a gamer, I may not even _like_ RPG's. And here's this app, it's in the _top spot_, and I decide to give a token of _trust_. I open up the app, and am presented with a black screen, and a single progress bar. I press the "light fire" button, and the screen changes color. I play for 5 seconds?, 10 seconds?, 5 minutes? The "game" does effectively nothing, a few pieces of text comes onto the screen, the progress bar updates, some new buttons show up, leading to more progress bars, the screen changes colors... that's it?

I want immediate gratification for my _trust_, and I'm not getting that. My trust is short lived, since its being placed in the hands of complete strangers. I'm enraged, I'm so incredibly angry right now that I gave my trust to the developer, Apple, the reviewers, strangers, humanity... and I feel _betrayed_. So I leave a review to show my dissatisfaction:

>**Fake reviews** - It's literally the most repetitive boring game. Was interested for about half an hour thinking it would get better but after a whole and giving it a chance, it just turns out it's pointless tapping

>**Bit of a scam** - I bought this a week ago thinking the reviews looked positive. Now having played the game and read through further reviews I feel scammed. Poorly hidden "I don't usually write" fake reviews are littered everywhere.

>**SCAM!!!** - Worst game ever!!! Don't buy it! Reviews are fake!!!

>**Awful! The worst!** - his is the most awful game I have ever played ! It costs £0.69 which I would like back and it has fake reviews written about it by it's own company! DO NOT EVER BUY THIS "game".

>**Con Artist of 2014 award goes to...** - Well I don't usually write reviews either, but after reading the hundreds of reviews below I can only come to the conclusion that they were paid to do them....

When the game was in a quiet spot in the App Store, a lot of the downloads came from people recommending it word of mouth. You really couldn't find the game unless you specifically looked in the RPG section and scrolled down a couple of pages. When a real person, a friend, a fellow gamer, an esteemed editor recommends something to you... you give their recommendation more trust, and as a by product, you give A Dark Room more of your time.

The trust in the App Store, the trust in developers who develop products for the App Store is forever waning. And I can see the exhaustion and frustration that people feel (I feel it myself when I'm browsing for apps). And right now, that frustration is being directed to A Dark Room.

No, adding another screen shot or more details about the game won't help. One, because the game isn't visually appealing, and two, because I'm a stranger... I could be a scam artist that is putting up fake screen shots (I'm not of course). Most importantly, if I added any kind of hint to what was in the game, it would take away from the discovery that the player experiences. And I won't do that.

At this point, all I can do is wait. It takes anywhere from 3 hours to 3 days to beat the game and get a "review me" button presented to you. I have to put _my_ trust in the player, and hope that they take the time to review the game, and show that A Dark Room really is something brilliant and unique.

As a consolation, I've got some chuckles out of the reviews, specifically this one:

>**Avoid** - To summarise, I would actually rather be in a dark room, with nothing else is in it, until my untimely death before playing this app again. The endless time that is spent tapping could be spent building a time machine that would take you back to the time you pressed 'install' just so you can slap yourself in the face. Take your 70p and go purchase a lettuce and tap that, it would be more productive... And at the end you have a lettuce.

**Apr 2, 2014: Day Three, at the Number One Spot, in the UK App Store** <a href="#topappday3"><small>permalink</small></a>

A Dark Room has been in the top spot in the UK App Store for 3 days now. Downloads have fallen 56% from day two, but A Dark Room's rank still remains #1. From what I've observed so far, the rankings are heavily determined by the number of downloads you get (not the reviews). Given that the downloads are falling, this rank position may not last much longer.

I don't have enough data yet, but it seems like the rankings in the UK App Store _are_ influencing the US App Store. With no noticeable spike in US downloads, A Dark Room has jumped to the #9 spot in the RPG Category and the 146th spot in the Games category. That is both exciting and _terrifying_. From what I've read, the US App Store market share is 5 times the size of the UK.

The reviews have a definite pattern. You either _love_ the game or _hate_ it. Here are the review number for yesterday:

- 5-star: 44
- 4-star: 3
- 3-star: 0
- 2-star: 1
- 1-star: 26

The reactions in the reviews continue to be visceral. Here are a couple:

>**Amazingly bad!** - I lasted 30 seconds. I dont know what's worse, being charged more than a penny for this rubbish or reading the obviously faked reviews after purchasing or finding the developers epic long long long faked diary in making this 'game' that a 5 year old could put together. he also actually seems to believe that no one can review the 'game' without having completed it! Will be getting onto apple for a refund. Yes i can do that too!

>**Fraudsters!!** - This game is awful. All the reviews are fake. The people behind this have broken the law as this is clearly fraudulent activity designed to get you to part with your money for false promises. Absolute disgrace. Pure theft. Pure criminality.

One person from the UK actually "called @ADarkRoomiOS out" on Twitter. Against my better judgement, I decided to engage with her. I'm glad I did. Conversation follows:

>her - @ADarkRoomiOS what a con! Waste of money, I wish I could warn others the reviews are fake.

>me - I'm truly sorry you feel conned. More info about the game here, please take a moment to read if you can: http://amirrajan.net/a-dark-room/

>me - did you get a chance to read the development log I had put up with regards to A Dark Room and my sabbatical?

>her - I'm sure the game is great; maybe it's just not for me. But all the best to you, and I hope your success grows.

>me - I appreciate that, but perhaps put yourself in my shoes. Any ideas how I can communicate that it isn't a con?

>her - hey look, don't pay attention to the likes of me. Keep creating and keep making the cash, I would do the same!

>me - thank you... you're a part of A Dark Room's history now. In a good way. :-)

>her - haha thanks! Maybe I should reinstall the app and uninstall my ignorance

**Apr 4, 2014: The Fall From the #1 Spot in the UK App Store. Here Are the Final Numbers** <a href="#topappday5"><small>permalink</small></a>

After <s>four</s> five days in the top spot of the UK App Store, A Dark Room finally dropped to the #2 spot.  Observations:

- You either love A Dark Room or hate it.
- Once you make it to the top 5 of your category, things begin to pick up.
- There doesn't seem to be any correlation between the UK and US App Stores.
- The US App Store is _definitely_ larger than the UK App Store.

Here are the final numbers leading up to the #1 spot in the UK:

Date | Downloads (UK) | RPG Rank (UK) | Overall Rank (UK)
:--- | -------------: | ------------: | ----------------:
3/22 |             40 |            10 |               403

4/03 |            176 |             6 |               242

During the 5 days at the top spot, users of the UK App Store gave A Dark Room the following ratings:

- 5 stars: 195
- 4 stars: 17
- 3 stars: 2
- 2 stars: 6
- 1 stars: 94

As for the reviews, I'd be lying if I said that I wasn't affected emotionally by people claiming that A Dark Room was a scam and I was a con artist. There were three individuals on Twitter that actually called out A Dark Room publicly. I addressed each tweet individually, exercising an extreme amount of empathy. Each person ended up retracting their statement about A Dark Room and apologizing (one even said that they'd give A Dark Room another shot). If anything, this was preparation for what _will_ come if I make it to a top spot in the US App Store.

**Apr 9, 2014: #1 RPG, #5 Game, #10 App, in the US** <a href="#topofus"><small>permalink</small></a>

Here we are. Ten days after A Dark Room made it to the #1 spot in the UK. This morning, A Dark Room is ranked #1 in the RPG category, #5 in the Games category, and is the #10 app, _overall_. I still have no idea what's happening. I don't know definitively whether the buzz in the United Kingdom somehow caused the same kind of viral outbreak in the United States.

But (so far) the trends are holding. As soon as A Dark Room hit the #1 spot in the RPG category, a snowball effect occurred (similar to what I saw in the UK). If you look at the [rank progression in the UK](#topappday5), you'll notice that A Dark Room hit the #1 spot overall, three days after it became #1 in the RPG category. A Dark Room hit the #1 RPG spot, in the US, late on April 6th... which makes day number 3, today. I doubt it'll jump 10 spots in one day, but it's worth noting how similar the trends are.

Outside of impacts associated with being #1 in the UK. The following _may_ have given A Dark Room more steam in the United States.

As soon as A Dark Room hit the #1 spot in the UK I reposted what I wrote here on /r/gamedev: [What happens when your iOS game goes viral and becomes the #1 app in the UK App Store](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/220quk/what_happens_when_your_ios_game_goes_viral_and/). The post received 200 up votes, and there were many good conversations to be had.

Out of sheer luck. A Reddit user asked the following question on /r/askreddit, which Michael ended up responding to: [Has anyone here ever built a $20 or $40 desktop application, or $0.99 to $5 mobile app, and made real money from it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/227qln/has_anyone_here_ever_built_a_20_or_40_desktop/cgk7rhp). The question received 1159 upvotes, and Michael's response was the top comment.

Around this same time, a review site, that I reached out to a couple weeks ago, gave A Dark Room 3 stars (the review said mostly good things about the game, so put your torches and pitchforks down): [148Apps - A Dark Room Review](http://www.148apps.com/reviews/dark-room-review/)

That's all that's happened as far as I know. A Dark Room has dropped to #5 in the UK. Downloads are still dropping and haven't leveled off. Positive reviews out score negative reviews 3 to 1. Given what I've seen in the UK, if A Dark Room does indeed hit the top spot, it won't stay there for long.

<a id="number1us"> </a>

**Apr 15, 2014: #1 in the App Store** <a href="#number1us"><small>permalink</small></a>

A Dark Room iOS finally clawed its way to the #1 spot. It happened on April 13, 2014. It took seven, very long days to make it there from the #1 RPG spot. I was in shock when it passed Mine Craft in the rankings. I literally gasped out loud when it passed Monument Valley. I laughed sinisterly when it took down RBI Baseball 14 (an officially licensed game of the MLB). This marks the third day at the #1 spot.

The trends in the United Kingdom should give an indication as to what will happen in the US. Here are some observations and predictions:

- The US App Store market is a little over 3x the size of the UK (not 5x).
- iPad sales have been insignificant relative to iPhone.
- Not a single major gaming website has done a piece about A Dark Room (yet).
- The reviews in the US have been overall positive! (a ratio of 9 to 1 as opposed to UK's 3 to 1)
- A Dark Room will fall out of the #1 US spot _very_ soon.
- It'll see a 20% drop in downloads, day over day, until it levels out.
- It'll take ~25 days for this "leveling" to occur.

In the UK, A Dark Room is currently ranked #12. It _seems_ that the game has finally leveled out (or at least the fall has slowed down considerably). A Dark Room is averaging 400 downloads a day over there.

I'll of course continue to post new observations as soon as I have more data. Also, there is going to be another _unique_ update to the game that may cause another viral out break (probably not, but I can hope).

tl;dr; I won't be able to retire on the revenue A Dark Room is generating (not by a _long_ shot), but it'll definitely extend my sabbatical.

<a id="newnormal"> </a>

**Apr 29, 2014: Waiting for the New Normal** <a href="#newnormal"><small>permalink</small></a>

A Dark Room has been #1 in the App Store for 17 days now. During that 17 day period, the game has gotten 241,494 downloads. Every trend and projection I've made against what I saw in the UK has been broken:

1. In the UK, it took 3 days to make it to the #1 spot overall, from the #1 RPG spot. In the US, this took 7 _long_ days.

2. In the UK, A Dark Room was taken out of the #1 spot by an Apple Editor's Choice pick (Monument Valley). In the US, A Dark Room has survived _two_ Editor's Choice picks (Hitman GO and Leo's Fortune).

3. In the UK, the reviews had a ratio of 3 positive reviews for every 1 negative. The negative reviews called the game a scam and claimed that all the other reviews were bought by me. In the US, the reviews have a ratio of 9 positive reviews for every 1 negative review. There are some that state the game is a scam, but most of the critical reviews in the US are valid (they found the game boring, over hyped, incomplete, etc).

4. In the UK, A Dark Room stayed at the #1 spot for 6 days. I thought to myself "Okay, it took twice as long to get to #1 in the US, I can expect to stay at #1 twice as long." A Dark Room is going on to the 18th day now.

5. In the UK, A Dark Room's downloads dropped 20% day over day after the initial days at #1. In the US, the downloads are _level_ and spiked _again_ on 4/20 and 4/27. None of this makes sense.

Every day has been a bit stressful. Which app will take me out of the top spot?

1. Goat Rampage: A game "inspired" by the viral hit Goat Simulator. How the heck is A Dark Room going to survive a popular meme? For four days, I kept a close eye on this game, waiting for it to swap places with me and take the #1 spot. It didn't.

2. Hitman GO: When this was featured by Apple, I thought I was done. Here is a game built by a powerhouse, Square Enix. What chance does A Dark Room have against that kind of shop? A Dark Room survived.

3. The Amazing Spider 2: This game was wire to wire with Hitman GO, climbing up the ranks. Two threats at the same time. A Dark Room survived.

4. Heads Up!: On April 22nd, Ellen DeGeneres plays Heads Up! on her talk show. The game shoots up to #2. How the hell will A Dark Room survive a game that has _celebrity sponsorship_? It did.

5. Wayward Souls: A rouge-like RPG with a cult following. So incredibly awesome that it's available on iOS. "If Wayward Souls takes out ADR, I'm okay with that. That will be an honorable defeat," I said to myself. But it fell down the ranks too.

6. Leo's Fortune: Apple stops promoting Hitman GO and picks Leo's Fortune. Another beautiful game that showcases the "beauty of iOS". I watch it climb day after day. And then it drops too.

7. Blek: This game, just yesterday, jumped _13_ spots in one day to claim #2. It's built by an indie dev too. I know he is going through the same thing I've been going through. A mix of hope and stress. He is eyeing how quickly he gets new reviews, he probably wakes up in the middle of the night to see if he's over taken A Dark Room... just like I wake up to see if I'm still #1.

Now, all I can do is survive till Tuesday. Tuesday, is a magical day. It's the day where the media takes notice of the top apps in the App Store (whether they want to acknowledge A Dark Room or not). This however doesn't cause any kind of spike in downloads. But it's nice seeing what the internet has to say about A Dark Room every time it survives another week. By far, the best unsolicited article was published by [The Knox Student](http://www.theknoxstudent.com/news/2014/04/17/procrastination-station-mobile-gaming-for-hipsters/).

All I can do now is wait for the "new normal". That moment where I get used to this unfamiliar terrain, and I can finally get a decent night's sleep.

This is the best way I can describe what I'm feeling right now: I've bought a lottery ticket, and the lottery commission has revealed 5 of the 6 numbers. And so far, I've gotten those 5 numbers right. I know I've got at least the winnings for those 5 numbers in the bag. But now I'm waiting for the 6th number... that jackpot number that changes your life forever. The lottery commission hasn't revealed the 6th number yet, they haven't even told me when they'll show the 6th number. So I'm stuck in this weird limbo, where others see success and all I can do is temper expectations, be "responsible", and move forward as if that 6th number will be wrong.... still number 1, just checked.

<a id="thefall"> </a>

**May 6, 2014: The Fall from the US Top Spot** <a href="#thefall"><small>permalink</small></a>

It finally happened. On April 30th, around 5pm, A Dark Room lost the #1 spot in the US App Store to Blek. I knew ADR would lose the spot at some point, but its still hard to describe what I felt when that happened.

I refresh the App Store list on my iPhone and see the two mostly-black icons still holding the number one and number two spot (A Dark Room and Blek). It takes a split second to realize that the #1 spot isn't A Dark Room anymore. I feel defeated and relieved. The climax of this story has passed. I am finally into the falling action and dénouement.

During this time period, A Dark Room received quite a bit of news coverage:

- Not [one](http://www.cultofmac.com/277035/dark-room-iphone-top-paid-game/), but [two](http://www.cultofmac.com/277118/dark-room-lights-app-store-big-heart-open-world/) write ups on The Cult of Mac, an online publication that reaches _millions_.
- A write up on [Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/01/a-dark-room-iphone-game_n_5241335.html), which reaches _millions_ (even Ellen DeGeneres follows them on Twitter).
- A write up on Medium by [Barrett Sheridan](https://medium.com/@bsheridan), formerly a tech editor at Bloomberg Businessweek.
- An interview with DFW CBS 11... I was on local TV! But I don't have cable/bunny ears, so I couldn't watch it #sadpanda.
- An article/interview for the Dallas Morning News.
- That plus a few small independent blogs wrote about the game.

All this, and A Dark Room _still_ fell from #1. It's, in fact, struggling to keep the #6 spot now. US downloads have dropped 80% from the weeks before. On the bright side, being out of the top spot gave me the window to push out a crucial release of the game. The reviews will reset, but it's (now) worth the risk.

In other news, on Apr 29th, ADR hit the #1 spot in both Australia and Singapore.

- In Singapore, ADR got 161 downloads at the top spot and fell soon after.
- It took only a day to get there after becoming #1 under RPGs.
- In Austrialia, ADR got 1300 downloads, but _rose_ for another 3 days, before starting its plummet.
- It took 7 days to get to the top after being #1 under RPGs.
- Reviews have been mostly positive in both countries.

With regards to reviews, I still wonder why the app [was received so negatively in the UK](#topappday2). Here are my two working theories:

- Smaller markets are more susceptible to scam apps. It's much easier for an app to quickly move to a high spot with a hundred or so paid for reviews.
- Reviews are ordered based on number of stars and length. The top reviews _set the tone_ for the rest of the reviews. I think we are subconsciously influenced by the "top" reviews. If a long, critical/angry 1-star review is posted (and the velocity for new reviews is low), then that "top" negative review will influence every person that tries out your app. In the case of the UK, a couple of reviews were long and extremely negative, calling the game a scam. And they stayed at the "top of the list" for a long, long time.

The stress I've continued to feel is this lack of consistency. No market is the same, download numbers are a constant roller coaster (the game spiked moderately in the UK again yesterday), human behavior isn't predictable, and media impact is hard to correlate. All in all the App Store feels impossible to rationalize.

With regards to the new release. There is a "secret" that I added, which is only available to those that have beaten the game. We'll see what kind of impact it has to downloads and review velocity. I expect review conversion rates to _significantly_ increase for those that have beaten the game. Regardless... I feel that A Dark Room's time at #1 has passed, and I won't see that spot again.

**May 26, 2014: A Dark Room's Second Wind** <a href="#secondwind"><small>permalink</small></a>

Twenty four days ago, A Dark Room fell from the #1 spot. This fall gave me the opportunity to release an updated version of the game. With the release, ADR lost its average rating, and all of its glowing reviews got archived.

The new release was an attempt to deepen the connection the game had with the current fan base. If you've beaten the game at least once, a section to the game would be unlocked where you can listen to developer commentary given by me and Michael.

I had started working on this commentary back in March. [Around this time](#mysterysolved) it didn't look like ADR was gaining any ground... I was entertaining the idea of making ADR free, and providing the developer commentary as an In-App Purchase. I was nearing finished with the release of the IAP, but ADR suddenly [went viral in the UK](#minecraft). Given the risk involved with resetting reviews, I decided to hold off on publishing the new version. When ADR made it to the [#1 spot in the US](#number1us), Michael and I decided to remove the IAP and release the commentary as a free update to the game.

[ADR fell](#thefall). I published that same day. By the time the new release hit the App Store (a week later), ADR's rank had fallen to the #7 spot over all. The next day, the game fell another spot. But then, two days after the release (9 days after falling from #1)... ADR stopped falling. It gained one rank day after day. By May 23th (22 days after the fall), A Dark Room made it back to the #1 spot.

So many variables were at play during this 22 day rise back to the top. I've done my best to summarize what all occurred. Any conclusions I draw are pretty speculative given that time and time again my predictions are proven wrong.

_Variable 1: App price drops_

Blek, the #1 game in the App Store made a smart move. About 4 days into their #1 streak, they dropped the price for their game to $0.99. [I did something similar](#pricedrop) back when I was struggling to stay relevant in the RPG category. Imagine what kind of increase Blek saw when they dropped the price of their game by _66%_. From what I've observed, a drop in price leads to an inversely proportional increase in downloads (with the added benefit of being able to say "I'm running a sale"). This little maneuver solidified Blek's #1 spot.... until A Dark Room took it back.


_Variable 2: Review velocity and quality_

Here is ADR's rating breakdown along with "quality" metrics (average number of words).

From Apr 8th to May 6th (version 1.5 without developer commentary), ADR received the following review breakdown:

- 5 stars: 3,710 ~82%
- 4 stars: 301 ~6%
- 3 stars: 107 ~2%
- 2 stars: 81 ~2%
- 1 stars: 345 ~8%
- Average Rank (not to be confused with rating): 2.44
- Total reviews: 4,544
- Reviews per day: ~162
- Conversion Rate: 1.47%
- Average Review Length: 31 words

From May 7th to May 25th (version 1.6, with developer commentary), ADR received the following review breakdown:

- 5 stars: 1,613 ~87%
- 4 stars: 72 ~4%
- 3 stars: 24 ~1%
- 2 stars: 33 ~1%
- 1 stars: 95 ~5%
- Average Rank (not to be confused with rating): 3.60
- Total reviews: 1,837
- Average reviews per day: ~102
- Conversion Rate: 1.61%
- Average Review Length: 38 words

It _does_ seem that the developer commentary helped give a little more reason to give a 5 star review (but not by much). Outside of that, it doesn't look like the new release significantly impacted ADR's rise.

_Variable 3: Number of downloads before hitting #1_

It took a much longer time to get back to #1 from similar "low" ranks. It took fewer average downloads, but a longer period of time.

Number of downloads from the #15 spot to the #1 spot on version 1.5:

- 4/08: 2,153
- 4/09: 4,310
- 4/10: 6,152
- 4/11: 7,669 (placed #2, day before #1)
- Average: 5,071
- Total: 20,284

Number of downloads from the #7 spot to the #1 spot on version 1.6:

- 5/07: 2,820
- 5/08: 2,531
- 5/09: 3,074
- 5/10: 3,528
- 5/11: 4,135
- 5/12: 4,878
- 5/13: 6,659
- 5/14: 6,164
- 5/15: 6,271
- 5/16: 6,300
- 5/17: 6,052
- 5/18: 5,690 (placed #2 in the US, #1 in Canada!)
- 5/19: 4,313
- 5/20: 4,845
- 5/21: 5,462 (day before #1 in the US)
- Average: 4,848
- Total: 72,722

_Variable 4: Relative performance of others in the App Store_

Heads Up! briefly knocked Blek out of its #1 spot (for a few hours), but soon fell back to #2 (and then #3). On the 14th, Ellen DeGeneres [posted a Heads Up! session with Emily Blunt](http://www.ellentv.com/videos/0-vrobj813/), which may have contributed to its very brief bump. But that's how Heads Up! rolls (see what I did there). It's an quality game with celebrity sponsorship. And because of this, it's held a top 10 spot _since May of 2013_.

Minecraft is Minecraft. This game is an "expensive" premium app with a review velocity of _300+ a day_. I think it's found a happy balance between rank and price. It's held a top 10 spot _since July of 2013_.

Plague Inc. has had a volatile existence. Its rank has fluctuated in the top 20 _since May of 2012_. That's _two years_ of "top spot" daily revenue.

Blek (can I call it my arch nemesis?) did an awesome job with timing its sale, making it really hard to take back #1. They _did_ eventually change the price back to $2.99, which may have contributed to their fall.

I have no idea what kind of price elasticity exists with regards to high ranking apps. My assumption is that Blek is measuring this elasticity themselves, or felt that net revenue at a lower rank/higher price was better than net revenue at a higher rank/lower price.

Michael and I have wondered what would happen if we increased the price of ADR, but have decided against it. Other games have precedence on other platforms, are celebrity backed, or have been around a long time. They show everything they have to offer, invest a lot in marketing, and ask for a fair price up front. ADR has no official media coverage, says nothing in the description, looks absolutely ridiculous with its single screen shot, and asks for $0.99.

To summarize my summary:

- The v1.6 update didn't seem to have a noticeable effect on ADR's rise back to the top.
- There's an incredibly complex symbiotic relationship with other ranked apps.
- It's too soon to tell how ADR will perform in the long run.

One thing's for sure, this roller coaster isn't over yet. Oh look... we're back at #2... Blek dropped their price back to $0.99. Oh look... estimated federal taxes are due next month... time to visit with my CPA again. Oh look! [Ruboto](http://ruboto.org/)! Oh look... [ADR scam apps](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/a-dark-room-game/a7fd3901-7020-4cb8-93b4-fdf3974dd205)... `(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻`

<a id="grrr"> </a>

**Jun 20, 2014: Taxes, Negative Reviews, Clones, and Open Source** <a href="#grrr"><small>permalink</small></a>

Alrighty, this one has been on my mind for a while. It's going to be difficult to exercise empathy and be tactful within this post, but I'll try. Let's get started.

_Taxes_

There's no escaping it, you have to pay taxes. ADR is subject to income taxes. Period. No way around it. And given that App Store revenue is considered self employment income, I get hit with an additional 15% self employment tax, all of which has to be paid quarterly. Paying estimated taxes in itself has its challenges given the volatility of the App Store revenue. I don't want to get penalized for underpaying, but at the same time, I don't what to give the government an interest free loan either. June 15th, I wrote a check to the IRS for $60,000. Based on projections of this depreciating asset, I'll have to pay $30,000 quarterly. Hopefully the annual amortization is accurate, and I end up owing a penalty free amount at the end of the year.

So... after Apple's 30% take, royalties of 50% (no complaints here, ADR iOS wouldn't exist if it weren't for Michael's permission), and then a 45% hit in income taxes, I net 19.5 _cents_ on every download. YTD downloads are ~635,000. No way in hell we'll get that many downloads H2.

The terrifying part is that very few apps see even a fraction of this success. So think twice before selling almost everything you own, taking a year long learning sabbatical, and spending months porting a minimal text based RPG to mobile... you may be better off building apps after hours, or charging high dollar hourly rates to build an app for some company.

_Negative Reviews_

Just as death and taxes are inevitable, so are negative reviews for A Dark Room. I've been keeping a collection of [heart warming positive reviews here](http://adarkroomios.com/reviews.html), I hope you find them a great read. Let's enumerate the categories of negative reviews.

The _Honest, Critical_ Review:

A number of reviews in the App Store fall into this category. They are fair, well written, and simply didn't like what they bought. They spent the time to share their thoughts and warn others.

>Not That Brilliant... (1 star): The novelty of this game wears down almost immediately after the first time around. The whole point of this I suppose is to make us introspective and question particular things in the universe. But as much as this game would like you to think, you're not really in control. The fate of the game has pretty much been decided and no matter what you do there are pre ordained responses that characters like 'the builder' will have no matter what. I found that incredibly annoying.I guess it got the message through to me, but I don't think of this game as very deep or thought-provoking. Give me Angry Birds any day and I'll ponder the higher meaning of destroying smiling green pigs while actually believing that my 1 dollar wasn't for naught.

The _It's a Scam_ Review:

[I've talked about this before (and exercised large amount of empathy when doing so)](#empathy), so let me be a little mean. Here's the review:

>Absolute scam!! Manipulated reviews!! (1 star):	It's a text based game. That's ALL you get. Nothing like any review said how fancy and interesting the game play is. I suspect all the reviews are done by the developer himself using auto generated review. It is done by developer by purchasing the game himself through hundreds, if not thousands iTunes account, then give good rating over a period of time.

And here's my response:

>Dear reviewer, you're an idiot.

The _I didn't get my money's worth_ Review:

I live in a world where we carry $600 super computers in our pockets. We pay $15 for a two hour movie leaving satisfied, but paying $0.99 for _only_ two hours of entertainment is considered a rip off.

>Not worth the .99 (1 star): I beat the game in 2 hours, and the game doesn't do anything to reward you for winning. I like the game but it's missing depth and replay value.

The _Ransom_ Review:

The App Store is actually a great way to get feedback on what's broken. Pay attention to these "ransom" reviews. Because they'll give you insight on what needs to be fixed.

>Magnificent (3 stars): Game but the thieves take too long	Great game, i read your post about the making of the game and I am very sorry about making a 3 star review, but I spent more than 30 minutes with the thieves. I hope they'll go away soon, and the second they do ill rate it 5 stars. Thank you.

In this case though, [I've already nerfed the thieves once](#blindversionreleased), I'm not doing it again.

The _Just Plain Mean_ Review:

Welp. They are just mean. Really mean. No other way to describe them.

>What is this? (2 stars) - Before I bought this I was unsure so I looked at the reviews. They were all glowing which intrigued me, so I downloaded.. Played for about 2 minutes then deleted it! Absolute load of rubbish, it's sort of like sims but with no graphics, like a weird text version. Just utter nonsense how it has so many good reviews! If it was between watching a blind man trying dismantle a computer and playing this came I know which one I'd get bored of first!

The _Leg Sweeper_ Review:

These reviews are simply there to bring you down. They want so badly to explain the success of something they don't see as "good". Belittling me, and others that have reviewed the game. These are by far the most poisonous reviews. They bring me down and bring down every other person who played and enjoyed the game.

>Garbage (1 star) - It's so nice to have this hive-mind community full of hipsters and morons raving about the worst goddamn games. Same thing happened with Angry Birds and Flappy Birds. You people are disgusting. Horrible unwashed masses of brainless consumers. Hey morons, take a step back and really consider the piece of crap you rated 5 stars. No, really, just take a moment.

I have no words for this person. Here's another:

>Snake Oil (1 star) -	A cynical/realist lawyer's perspective..Finished the entire game, thoroughly, discovering all the secrets. Listened to the end commentary.  Only did so because I was promised an emotional experience, which is something no game has really done for me since, oh, Final Fantasy 10 or so.  Here, there was none to be had. This is just a 1980's, pre-Final Fantasy text-based RPG with some Friedrich Nietzche quotes thrown in. The plot twist toward the end of the game is trite and unmoving for anyone who has ever played a few video games or watched a few sci-fi movies.So why has this game blown up with so many gushing reviews? At the end of the game, the two developers left 20 minutes of commentary, in which they talk about their emotional and philosophical struggle creating the game, Friedrich Nietszche (who really has nothing to do with the game), and how the game changed the lives of blind people. Then they ask that you leave a review. Well, here's my review. Don't be fooled...

Here's my reply, again with a lack of empathy:

>How do you explain v1.5's 18 day streak at #1? There wasn't any developer commentary in that one asking people to review ADR. Lawyered.

Here are the YTD numbers for 1 star reviews:

- United Kingdom: 191 of 1081 (18%)
- Canada: 68 of 767 (9%)
- Singapore: 4 of 46 (9%)
- Australia: 51 of 605 (8%)
- United States: 557 of 8730 (6%)

Lesson learned. Don't release text based adventures to the UK. I've become numb to the words "rubbish", "bore", "scam/fake reviews", and "dreadful" because of the UK.

_Clones and the Spirit of Open Source_

Michael released ADR under MPL. And what do some do? They take what Michael built, wrap it in a browser control. They add advertisements at the bottom of the screen, and deploy it to the App Stores/Google Play as a free app. We've requested take downs for some of these apps. And they simply give us the finger by using the MPL as their defence.

It's frustrating, not that these apps exist, _but that these bottom feeding apps are being created by developers who went onto GitHub and cloned Michael's repo._ Michael said it best:

>I open-sourced A Dark Room exactly because I wanted people to be able to learn from it, and use it as a starting point for their own projects. That said, I'll admit to being a little disheartened that people are taking advantage of the brand that I've built to make a quick buck.

What these devs are doing is legal (outside of potential common law trademark violations, but that'll be a whole-nother entry). Morally, however, this goes against the grain of what open source is all about. And that, is truly heart breaking.

**Aug 11, 2014: One Million Downloads in Seven Days** <a href="#million"><small>permalink</small></a>

It's been over a month since I've posted. I've slowly watched the rank and downloads of A Dark Room fall day over day. I thought there was a point where ADR's daily downloads would level out, but there really wasn't. By the end of July, A Dark Room was bringing in approximately 200 downloads a day. This is a level I haven't seen since [February where I did a 50% off sale](#pricedrop). Isn't that insane? A game that took the #1 spot for 18 days straight was now averaging downloads as if it were a game that just hit the App Store. I guess this shows again that you can't count on a consistent income from the App Store.

One thing was different however with these downloads. I was slowly increasing the price of ADR to $3.99. At this point, it was safe to assume that the game wasn't being "sold" by its overall game ranking (which was barely in the top 100), and most downloads (if not all) were coming from the fact that ADR was one of the top 5 RPG's. Here are some download numbers at each price point. You'll notice that there is _very little_ inelasticity in price (even for top ranking apps).

[ Date ] | [ Downloads ] | [ Price Point ] | [ Revenue\* ] | [ RPG Rank ] |
:------- | ------------: | --------------: | ----------:   | -----------: |
7/14     |           756 |            0.99 |         756   |            1 |

7/18     |           339 |            1.99 |         678   |            2 |
7/19     |           373 |            1.99 |         746   |            2 |
7/20     |           432 |            1.99 |         864   |            2 |

7/24     |           230 |            1.99 |         460   |            3 |
7/25     |           221 |            1.99 |         442   |            3 |
7/26     |           195 |            2.99 |         585   |            3 |
7/27     |           275 |            2.99 |         825   |            4 |
7/28     |           237 |            2.99 |         711   |            4 |
7/29     |           142 |            3.99 |         568   |            4 |
7/30     |           145 |            3.99 |         580   |            6 |

_\*Revenue before Apple's cut and before taxes take out a huge chunk of the earnings (made the math easier)_

You'll notice that while revenue stayed about level, my rank dropped. This is in line with what I've seen in the past (download count is king). So here I am sitting at the #6 spot, exactly [where I was five months ago before the game ever went viral](#top6). Looking through my dev logs, [I decided to do exactly what I did back then](#freeagain): I made the game free to bring in "new blood".

Then, the impossible happened. On day one of being free, ADR received 36,831 downloads. Day two, A Dark Room sky rocketed to 111,209 downloads. In 48 hours, ADR went from being ranked as the 329th app overall to the 32th. I decided to see how far ADR could go. On the third day ADR had passed Candy Crush, Clash of Clans, Kim Kardashian, and pretty much everything else. By the 7th day, A Dark Room was the #3 app in the App Store overall, out ranked by the Facebook Messaging App (which everyone was forced to download), and Crazy Taxi (which was being promoted by Apple at the time). Here are the download numbers for those 7 days:

- 8/1: 36,831 (went free mid day)
- 8/2: 111,209
- 8/3: 203,882
- 8/4: 223,006
- 8/5: 213,379
- 8/6: 187,014
- 8/7: 43,307 (flipped back to paid mid day)
- Total: 1,018,628
- Total Reviews: Jumped from 7,800 to 11,914 (4,114 reviews)

As far as media coverage, Pocket Tactics, 148Apps, and Touch Arcade wrote about this sale. Extra Credits was kind enough to tweet about it too (they rock). It's hard to say how much of an impact they really had to the download numbers given that [media coverage in the past really hasn't helped ADR](#zoe) (but I may be wrong).

Now the big question, what happened to sales when I flipped it back to paid? Well... I'm still collecting data. Will post again soon ;-)

**Aug 20, 2014: What if ADR Was Written Using Cordova and Was Ad Based?** <a href="#alternateuniverse"><small>permalink</small></a>

It's something I've always wondered. What kind of fate would A Dark Room have had if I took the original web version, made it mobile friendly, wrapped it using PhoneGap, and added ads? What problems would I have come across? What kind of revenue would I have experienced. Well great news, one of my colleagues happens to be _god like_ with JavaScript and has recently released a puzzle game written in PhoneGap. I asked him to do a guest entry about his experience and what kind of ad revenue he's bringing in. Here it is!

_About Casey Foster_

During the day I am a web developer. I'm a core contributor on [Backbone](https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone) and more recently a huge fan of Facebook's [React](https://github.com/facebook/react). I use those tools daily to build and improve user interfaces at [OrgSync](http://www.orgsync.com). But while I love what I do at work, I've always had a passion for games and an itch to build and release a game of my own as a mobile app.

A couple years ago I first heard about [Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org) / [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com) and I just about cried I was so happy at the thought of not having to first learn Objective-C and Java, and then write the same game twice in separate languages to release on iOS and Android. Even better, the only thing I had to learn was a language I was already pretty adept at, JavaScript, and a bit of HTML and CSS. Say what you will about JS, but it's ubiquitous and definitely has, as Crockford would say, its good parts.

_Then I tried using Cordova_

The problem I found back then was that Cordova was just too young. The project was evolving rapidly and the documentation always seemed like it was lagging. At the time, the preferred method of using Cordova was downloading a zip file with the Cordova libraries for iOS, Android, etc. and then creating an Xcode project, Android/Eclipse project, etc. and manually linking those libraries to their respective projects.

This was probably a less frustrating task for iOS or Android developers, but not being a traditional iOS or Android developer, I was faced with many hurdles in this approach. I repeatedly ran into a plethora of build problems and error messages I wasn't prepared to debug. At that time, Cordova was not the solution I had hoped for and I wasn't willing to fight the framework until it cooperated.

I kept an eye on Cordova after that, but without a solid app idea I didn't have a reason to try it out again.

Then [2048](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/) came out and swept across the internet. It inspired me to create a puzzle game and with inspiration of other awesome puzzle games like [Trainyard](http://trainyard.ca), Gunoki was born.

> Fun Fact: The original name for Gunoki was Colorflick, but that name was already taken in the App Store. The second attempt at a name was Colorcraze, which was available in the App Store, but not in Google Play, so that was out.  After staring into space and churning through possible combinations of English words for what felt like days, I decided to take the make-up-your-own-word route. Gunoki was suggested by my wife and is derived from the names of our two dogs Gunner and Loki.

_PhoneGap Build_

Since JS, CSS, and HTML were still my weapons of choice for app development, I continued to have my mind set on Cordova. Given my previous frustrations with Cordova, I decided to give [PhoneGap Build](http://build.phonegap.com) (cordova app building as a service) a try. The goal of PhoneGap Build is to allow developers to upload their app assets (JS, CSS, HTML, images, etc.) and let their service run each platforms respective build process. The shared (and platform-specific) settings for each build are stored in a special `config.xml` file. This means you can define the name, description, bundle identifier, etc. of your app in one place and have it set in the correct spot for each platform automatically. After each build completes, the developer is given links to the final `.ipa`, `.apk`, etc. files that can be used for development or distribution. Even better, PhoneGap Build also has a sweet API that allows this whole processes to be handled programmatically.

Oh yea, and it's free (for one private project and infinite open source projects).

Being a big fan of automation (`make` can do wonders), I wrote a task to compile my game assets with [cogs](https://github.com/caseywebdev/cogs), zip and upload the assets to PhoneGap Build, download the finished `.ipa`, and then upload that to [TestFlight](https://testflightapp.com) so my testers and I could try it out.

I also have to highlight a huge advantage to building apps with Cordova is that you can test in the browser, no compilation necessary. This allows for a very fast development cycle since you're just a page refresh away from seeing your latest changes. This doesn't mean device/emulator testing isn't still crucial, but it does help.

PhoneGap Build worked great for me, but eventually I hit one of its limitations that I could not work around. PhoneGap Build allows developers to register plugins. Plugins create a bridge between platform-specific code and unify it with a single JavaScript API. One of the plugins I needed was for [AdMob](http://admob.com), but PhoneGap Build's policy only allows plugins that are 100% open source.  Unfortunately, parts of the AdMob SDK are shipped as a binary, which makes a plugin wrapping that SDK disqualified for use on PhoneGap Build.

This was where I parted ways with PhoneGap Build. It was time to figure out how to build these `.ipa` and `.apk` files locally on my machine.

_The New and Improved Cordova_

I was pleased to find that since the last time I used Cordova they had created an [npm](https://www.npmjs.org) package to distribute their new [CLI](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/3.5.0/guide_cli_index.md.html). After looking over the updated documentation, it appeared the entire process had been drastically simplified.  In fact, it had reached the point where there was no need to even open Xcode or the Android IDE and complete the entire build process with command line tools.

Heading back to my handy dandy `Makefile`, I added tasks to create the Cordova project, install my plugins, and build both debug and release versions of my app, all with the command line. This experience was much better than the one I had initially with Cordova. With the exception of me needing to update my provision profiles and certificates, the builds that the cordova command line interface output worked great.

One gripe I've had is that some of the properties I've added in `config.xml` seem to be ignored, at least in Cordova 3.5.0. For example, there is a property called `orientation` that accepts `portrait`, `landscape`, or `default` (both).  This is great in theory, except that this value never seemed to be respected in my builds and I ended up writing a script to manually edit the `.plist` for my Xcode project.

Other than the `config.xml` quirks, I've found Cordova to be a great tool for web developers to create *native* apps. JavaScript performance on the latest mobile operating systems is always improving and I believe it is a great option for apps that don't necessarily need top performance to succeed.

_The Numbers_

As of writing this, Gunoki has been available in the App Store and Google Play Store for about a week. Since Amir has been so transparent with his numbers, it seems only fitting to do the same (albeit these numbers are much smaller!).

Gunoki's first week numbers:

[ Platform ] | [ Downloads ] | [ Impressions ] | [ Clicks ] | [ Revenue ] |
:----------- | ------------: | --------------: | ---------: | ----------: |
iOS          | 444           | 7,877           |     111    | 15.34       |
Android      | 22            | 781             |       8    | 0.38        |
Total        | 466           | 8,658           |     119    | 15.72       |

If you're interested in playing it, **[Gunoki for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gunoki/id905840087)** and **[Gunoki for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coderiety.gunoki)** are both free to download. Enjoy!

_So What About A Dark Room, Amir?_

There was definitely a part of me that considered making the original web version mobile friendly, but [I originally chose to go native for the experience](#pickingdevenvironment). As for cross platform support, I lucked out with Ruboto and the eventual release of RubyMotion 3 (details on that will be another entry).

Now to answer the big question: What would ADR have made if it were free and ad based? I've already proven that [A Dark Room can be a top free app](#million). I also have a [time frame for retaining a top spot](#newnormal). And now I have some ad revenue numbers (thank you Casey). _So here is a really, really rough estimate of what ADR could have made:_

- Casey's super addicting puzzle game (_which you should download by the way_), has a 25% click through rate (444 downloads divided by 111 clicks).
- Each click got him $0.13 (111 clicks divided by $15.34 in revenue).
- You get _zero_ dollars for impressions.

So now let's apply that to A Dark Room's numbers.

- At its peak, A Dark Room received 223,000 free downloads in one day.
- During the peak in the paid section, A Dark Room received 20,000 downloads in one day.
- That's 10x the number of downloads in the free section versus paid.
- ADR's total paid downloads to date is 747,000 with a gross revenue of $522,900.
- If ADR were free, the ad revenue would be $242,775 (747,000 downloads, multiplied by a factor of 10, multiplied by 28% clicks, multiplied by $0.13 per click).

So, the good news is A Dark Room _was_ better off being a paid app. This also shows that the real money isn't in ads. It looks like all the top grossing apps make their money off of In-App Purchases. Welp. There you have it :-)

**Sep 27, 2014: After 1 Million Free Downloads, What Happened to Paid Sales?** <a href="#afteronemillion"><small>permalink</small></a>

Back in the beginning of August. [I made A Dark Room free for a week](#million). During that time period, ADR became the #3 App Overall in the free category. The only two apps that were ahead of ADR were the Facebook Messaging App, and Crazy Taxi (which was being featured by Apple). It's an incredible feeling to out rank the likes of Candy Crush, Kim Kardashian, and Clash of Clans. For that brief seven day period, ADR proved that a small game with heart can out rank games specifically engineered for IAP's.

After that seven day period, I made ADR a $0.99 app again. True, we didn't make any money during that seven day period, but maybe the _1 million_ new people that downloaded the game would carry over to paid downloads in some way. Here are the results after 45 days of watching the numbers and comparing it to the averages from before the "free week":

- When ADR went free, we got coverage from Extra Credits, 148 Apps, Reddit (r/AppHookup), and Pocket Tactics.
- ADR was priced at $3.99 before I made it free (this was on purpose so that sale syndication sites would see a more drastic drop).
- ADR became the #3 app overall gaining 1 million downloads and 4,000+ 5 star reviews.
- The free week was in celebration of ADR's upcoming prequel, [The Ensign](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-ensign/id908073488?mt=8) and Michael's new game [Gridland](http://gridland.doublespeakgames.com/).
- Around August 25th (after ADR was already back to paid), another media sweep happened on Gridland which trickled over to ADR.
- School went back in session. This is big deal because it looks like most of the people that play ADR are people in middle and high school. I have no concrete evidence outside of the decrease in sales I saw back when summer break started, and then the rise when school went back in session.
- We received no requests for interviews when ADR was the #3.
- The 45 day paid downloads for the week _before_ "free week" was **~907 per day**.
- The 45 day paid downloads for the week _after_ "free week" was **~1,022 per day**.
- The 45 day paid downloads for the week _including_ "free week" was **~901 per day**.

There you have it. After 1 million free downloads, 5 to 6 publications, school going back into session, and two new games; ADR's 45 day average remains unchanged. Maybe all the events that happened above helped _keep_ the 45 day average where it's at (which is also not great news).

Now what? Well. There are plenty of things I still want to talk about:

- iOS 8 has come out, what's the upgrade rate going to be?
- iPhone 6 and 6+ have come out, what's the sales distribution going to look like?
- The Ensign is in the App Store and is currently the #3 game under the RPG category and was actually featured as a "Best New Game".
- What kind of sales can you expect from a follow up title? How loyal are mobile gamers?
- What's the status of the Android port (tl;dr; it's not going well at all).

Until next time, take care... Oh, by the way. If you are a student in middle or high school, Michael and I would love to speak at your school about game development and coding (either over G+ or in person if your school is close to Ottawa, Canada or Dallas, TX). So don't hesitate to reach out to us if you're class room is interested.

**Dec 7, 2014: The Ensign and One Year of ADR** <a href="#oneyear"><small>permalink</small></a>

October was a quiet month. Nothing really changed with regards to download rates or rankings. [I took some time to reflect](http://amirrajan.net/rant/2014/11/30/id-give-anything/), knowing that ADR's one year anniversary was coming up. Has it really been a year since [one of the worst days of my life](#worstdayofmylife)? What did I really accomplish since [I decided to sell most of my worldly possesions and re-focus](http://amirrajan.net/meta/2014/03/16/rebooting-life-part-2/)? I'll have a Rebooting Life Part 3 blog entry coming soon to explore that. For now, let's talk about the prequel and what YTD earnings are for ADR.

_The Ensign_

A Dark Room's prequel (The Ensign) was released at the end of August. I wanted to make a brutally difficult [Soulsian Adventure](http://killscreendaily.com/articles/ensign/). I absolutely loved working on it. I stayed up the first night, burning the midnight oil. I simply couldn't sleep while there was this itch to scratch.

Given the following ADR had, I was able to actually get some beta testers to play the work in progress. It really helped to have others try the game out, give me feedback, and find spelling and grammar errors.

I released the game in August when I felt like _most_ of it was complete. I knew the game had some rough edges, and there were still story elements I wanted to expand on (that plus a nasty bug I have yet to track down). I took the same approach with releasing A Dark Room. It wasn't 100% done. iPad support wasn't there, some of the balancing and pacing wasn't perfect, and [story line progression left a few people stuck](#slaves2). But I released. A part of me was glad I took this approach, and the other part feels it was a mistake.

The first version of The Ensign received relatively lukewarm reviews from both [Kaijupop](http://kaijupop.com/2014/08/ios-quick-vid-ensign/) and [Touch Arcade](http://toucharcade.com/2014/08/22/the-ensign-review/). The Ensign was something I created on my own (the brilliant Michael Townsend was busy with [Gridland](http://gridland.doublespeakgames.com/)), so I was definitely struggling with imposter syndrome when those reviews came out.

**I really believe that game development is becoming more iterative. With digital media, it's incredibly easy for developers to fix problems and incorporate feedback. Given this, the current approach editors take to reviewing games is broken. While the game can improve, pivot, and grow, the lukewarm reviews are solidified in stone, rarely to be revisited.** I completely agree with Kaijupop and Touch Arcade, the _first_ version of The Ensign was not that great, but the _fourth_ version released over another _two_ months is consistently getting 5 star reviews. Here in lies my mistake, when you are a nobody like I was when I built ADR, it wasn't a big deal to iterate "live". But when you have a successful game out there, you're in the crosshairs, and have to execute _flawlessly_ (which is impossible).

That being said, when I released The Ensign, Apple featured it in their _Best New Games_, and _What We're Playing_ syndications. This led to The Ensign becoming the #8 game overall and pushed A Dark Room to the #7 spot. At first, I thought that download rates dictated if you were to be featured in _Best New Games_. **I thought it was an automated, software controlled syndication. Turns out it (probably) isn't.** There were two games that were also featured, and  sandwiched The Ensign in rankings. _The Firm_ sold for $0.99 and was ranked as the #1 game, and _PAC-MAN Friends_ selling for $2.99 was ranked #15 (The Ensign was #8 and sold for $0.99). For about a week, all three games were on the _Best New Games_ featured list. After that week, The Ensign was _removed_, but the other two games were still featured. I have no idea why this was done given that even the first version of The Ensign had higher ratings than the other two games (and was sandwiched in rankings... see now I want to have a yummy sammich).

I'm working on one more prequel. At one point, I wanted to just release a free blank app with an audio file stating my intent with the "pre-prequel". It would get a place holder out there, direct some App Store traffic to A Dark Room, and give me the opportunity to _iterate_ publicly on it. I don't think I'm brave enough to do that though. So for now, I'm operating under the unrealistic expectation of a flawless game being released, day one. That's all I have with regards to The Ensign, now lets talk about A Dark Room.

_A Dark Room After One Year_

Here is the (approximate) YTD revenue for A Dark Room, an app that took the #1 spot across the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, Canada, and Singapore.

[ Month ]    | [ Paid Downloads ] | [ Free Downloads ] | [ Apple Check ] |
:----------- | -----------------: | -----------------: | --------------: |
Nov 2013     | 403                |                    |           555   |

Oct 2014     | 14,900             |                    |        10,100   |
Nov 2014     | 5,040              | 134,959            |         3,790   |

The November 2014 paid downloads is not a typo. I made a mistake by making the game $1.99 again, and it destroyed our ranking in the RPG section. Lesson learned. I also made the game free for the first week of November in celebration of the one year anniversary (which I was happy to do, but that didn't help our rank either).

Total downloads (free and paid) is 1.96 million with a gross revenue of $553,000 (Apple has already taken it's 30% cut before issuing the checks). I started work on the app at the end of June. Here is the 16 month breakdown (4 months of development with no cash flow, and 12 months of income):

[ Month ]                                                 | [ Amount ] |
:-------------------------------------------------------- | ---------: |
Gross income (less Apple's share)                         |   553,000  |
My half of ADR (I happily give Michael his share)         |   276,500  |
33% income tax                                            |    91,245  |
12% self employment tax                                   |    33,120  |
Net                                                       |   152,135  |
Net per month (16 months from development to today)       |     9,508  |
Hourly (40 hrs, 48 weeks) doing ADR "full time"           |        59  |
Net hourly rate when I actually was working full time     |        51  |
16 month difference between ADR and 9-5                   |    14,280  |
Self employed medical insurance (wife was 1099 too)       |    10,880  |
*Grand total for making a #1 App*                         |    *3,400* |

There you go. You can either go to school, graduate from college, and (over a 7 year period) earn a pretty much guaranteed income. Or you can _try_ to team up with a friend, make a #1 app, and end up a _whopping_ $3,400 ahead (with no guarantee of future income)... I'm telling you now, ADR's success is a complete utter fluke, don't expect this for your app.

But, what have I learned about myself? I've learned that I have grit. I've done interviews with companies and they usually are unimpressed with my algorithmic/code related problem solving skills. But I have an endless reserve of sheer determination, intuition about software development, and the ability to _lead_... all of which is impossible to show in a couple of phone interviews and a one hour pairing session. I've learned that even though I can be _happy_, I will never, ever be _content_ (more on that in my Rebooting Life Part 3 entry).

As for what I've learned about the App Store... not a god damn thing. I still don't understand how [A Dark Room went viral in the UK](#minecraft). I don't understand how it became the [#1 app in the US](#number1us). I still don't understand how [A Dark Room got 1 million downloads when it went free](#million) (especially since I made it free again in the first week of November 2014, and didn't see that kind of download rate). I don't understand why A Dark Room is going viral _again_ in the UK _right now_ (yes, it's getting [one star reviews again](#topappday2)).

_What's Next_

This will be my last post here (unless something really amazing happens). I want nothing more than to be able to create worlds you can escape to. I don't think I'll stop building games anytime soon... nor will I stop writing and blogging. Subscribing below will be for my main blog. May the fire burn brightly for you. May it keep you warm.
