**Sep 27, 2014: After 1 Million Free Downloads, What Happened to Paid Sales?** <a href="#afteronemillion"><small>permalink</small></a>

Back in the beginning of August. [I made A Dark Room free for a week](#million). During that time period, ADR became the #3 App Overall in the free category. The only two apps that were ahead of ADR were the Facebook Messaging App, and Crazy Taxi (which was being featured by Apple). It's an incredible feeling to out rank the likes of Candy Crush, Kim Kardashian, and Clash of Clans. For that brief seven day period, ADR proved that a small game with heart can out rank games specifically engineered for IAP's.

After that seven day period, I made ADR a $0.99 app again. True, we didn't make any money during that seven day period, but maybe the _1 million_ new people that downloaded the game would carry over to paid downloads in some way. Here are the results after 45 days of watching the numbers and comparing it to the averages from before the "free week":

- When ADR went free, we got coverage from Extra Credits, 148 Apps, Reddit (r/AppHookup), and Pocket Tactics.
- ADR was priced at $3.99 before I made it free (this was on purpose so that sale syndication sites would see a more drastic drop).
- ADR became the #3 app overall gaining 1 million downloads and 4,000+ 5 star reviews.
- The free week was in celebration of ADR's upcoming prequel, [The Ensign](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-ensign/id908073488?mt=8) and Michael's new game [Gridland](http://gridland.doublespeakgames.com/).
- Around August 25th (after ADR was already back to paid), another media sweep happened on Gridland which trickled over to ADR.
- School went back in session. This is big deal because it looks like most of the people that play ADR are people in middle and high school. I have no concrete evidence outside of the decrease in sales I saw back when summer break started, and then the rise when school went back in session.
- We received no requests for interviews when ADR was the #3.
- The 45 day paid downloads for the week _before_ "free week" was **~907 per day**.
- The 45 day paid downloads for the week _after_ "free week" was **~1,022 per day**.
- The 45 day paid downloads for the week _including_ "free week" was **~901 per day**.

There you have it. After 1 million free downloads, 5 to 6 publications, school going back into session, and two new games; ADR's 45 day average remains unchanged. Maybe all the events that happened above helped _keep_ the 45 day average where it's at (which is also not great news).

Now what? Well. There are plenty of things I still want to talk about:

- iOS 8 has come out, what's the upgrade rate going to be?
- iPhone 6 and 6+ have come out, what's the sales distribution going to look like?
- The Ensign is in the App Store and is currently the #3 game under the RPG category and was actually featured as a "Best New Game".
- What kind of sales can you expect from a follow up title? How loyal are mobile gamers?
- What's the status of the Android port (tl;dr; it's not going well at all).

Until next time, take care... Oh, by the way. If you are a student in middle or high school, Michael and I would love to speak at your school about game development and coding (either over G+ or in person if your school is close to Ottawa, Canada or Dallas, TX). So don't hesitate to reach out to us if you're class room is interested.
